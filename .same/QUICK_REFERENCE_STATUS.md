## 📋 YOUR NEXT STEPS

### 1. Verify Railway Deployment ⏳
```bash
# Check Railway dashboard
https://railway.app

# Look for:
- Latest deployment: commit 5783aab
- Status: "Deployed" (green)
- No errors in deployment logs
```

### 2. Upload Test CSV ⏳
```csv
business_name,business_state_region
"ABC Trucking LLC","CA"
"XYZ Services Inc",""
"Unknown Business",""
```

### 3. Check Results ⏳

**Phase 4.7.0 Verification:**
- Job completes and reaches "done" status
- No 500 errors from /jobs/{job_id} endpoint
- Download button remains stable
- Error messages clear if issues occur

**Phase 4.6.5 Verification:**
- Download enriched CSV
- Verify `canonical_source` populated
- Verify `primary_phone` and `primary_email` coverage
- Check logs for multi-strategy Google attempts
